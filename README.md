This app creates a REST API for a job board.

It's main functionalities are to :

- Display the Job Listings and all the CRUD operations on them.
- Job Searching and filtering.
- Submiting applications for the jobs.

We also used an external API, to display Companies' Information,

There are differnet Access levels which are admin and user.
